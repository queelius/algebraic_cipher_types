A group is a set, G, together with an operation * that combines any two
elements a and b to form another element a*b. To qualify as a group, the set
and operation, (G, *), must satisfy four requirements known as the group
axioms:

Closure: For all a, b in G, the result of the operation, a*b, is also in G.

Associativity: For all a, b and c in G, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).

Identity element: There exists an element e in G such that, for every element a
in G, the equation e*a = a*e = a holds. Such an element is unique, and thus one
speaks of the identity element.

Inverse element: For each a in G, there exists an element a' in G such that
a*b=b*a=e, where e is the identity element.



Monoid:

A set S and an operation * : (S,S)->S is a monoid if:
- For all a,b,c in S, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).   (associativity)
- There exists a unique element e in S such that, for every element a in S,
  e*a = a*e = a.                           (identity element)
We denote this monoid by  (S,*,e).

In the cipher functor, we lift a monoid (S,*,e) by Cipher (S,*,e) A in the
following way.

1) A is a subset of S.

2) s : (S,N) \-> c S maps S to representations of S in c S, i.e., s(a,k) maps
   element a in S to the kth representation of a in c a.

3) s' : c S \-> S satisfies s'(s(a,k))=a and s(s'(j),k)=c a for any a in S
   and k in N. Note that since c S may be larger than S, 

   Note: Typically, s is generated by some other function parameterized by a
   secret and a fixed bit length for each representation.

Cipher [(S,*,e) A] has an operation (c *) : (c S,c S) -> c S is given by the
following axioms:
- 
- For all x,y,z in A, inv(s)((c x*c y)*c z) = inv(s)(c x*(c y*c z)).   (associativity)
- For all a,b,c in A, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).   (associativity)
- There exists a unique element e in S such that, for every element a in S,
  e*a = a*e = a.                           (identity element)



Cipher [(S,*,e) A f t] has an operation (c *) : (c S,c S) \-> c S given
by the following axioms:
- 
- For all a,b,c in A, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).   (associativity)
- There exists a unique element e in S such that, for every element a in S,
  e*a = a*e = a.                           (identity element)
